It’s a time consuming and meticulous process to ensure that statistics are accurate and timely. With open source software becoming more widely used, there’s now a range of tools and techniques that can be used to reduce production time, whilst maintaining and even improving the quality of the publications. This book is about these techniques: what they are, and how we can use them. This book was inspired by and draws heavily from a Government Digital Service blog post by Dr. Matthew Upson in the Better Use of Data team. "]
